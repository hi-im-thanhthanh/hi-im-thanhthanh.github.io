          modification.

        <p>
          The license term and/or licensed territory for the Platform Materials

          Materials will be displayed to you on the Platform in the manner of a
          statement, description, note or other indication. You shall read and
          be solely responsible for understanding the license term and licensed
          territory of the Platform Material you access, use or purchase. For
          clarify, regardless the license term specified for the relevant
          Platform Materials, the license term will terminate automatically if
          this Agreement is terminated, unless it is mandatorily required
          otherwise under applicable law.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any use of the Platform Material beyond applicable license scope of
          such Platform Material (e.g., your continued use of the Platform
          Material following the expiry or termination of the license term, your
          use of the Platform Material outside the license territory of such
          Platform Material) is a material breach of this Agreement. You are
          solely responsible for any claims or damages resulting from or in
          connection with your unauthorized use of Platform Materials.
