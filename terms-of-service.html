        <p><strong>8. Cloud Space Services</strong></p>

        <p>
          You may access limited cloud storage space provided by us on a
          free-of-charge basis; and you may also access more cloud storage space
          by subscribing to the relevant Premium Services, if such Premium
          Services are made available to you. Depending on the relevant Service
          Plan applicable to you (including without limitation the Premium
          Services to which you subscribe), the storage capacity of the cloud
          space allocated to you may differ. The allocated storage capacity
          applicable to the Premium Services you purchase will be displayed to
          you on the relevant Premium Services description page or when you make
          the purchase. You shall not use storage capacity exceeding the
          allocated storage capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Following the termination or expiration of your then current
          subscription term, if you choose not to renew your subscription, you
          will no longer have cloud space storage capacity, or, if we provide
          users with certain cloud space storage capacity for free, you will be
          downgraded to such free storage capacity. If you choose to downgrade
          your Premium Services, you will be downgraded to the storage capacity
          applicable to the Premium Service you select. For the avoidance of
          doubt, you acknowledge and agree that we have no obligation to provide
          or continue to provide any user with a cloud space storage capacity
          plan for free.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you in advance
          if the cloud space storage capacity applicable to you will be degraded
          or become unavailable. Within the time limit that we notify you of in
          advance, you should transfer and back up your content (including but
          not limited to your video drafts, photos, stickers and other
          materials) stored in the cloud space provided by the Platform before
          the expiration of such Service Plan, and ensure that, in case your
          storage capacity is downgraded, the content you store does not exceed
          the storage capacity that you are entitled to use, so as to avoid the
          loss of your content and data due to the absence of sufficient cloud
          space storage capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to these Terms, you shall comply with the applicable
          requirements and restrictions applicable to the cloud space storage
          services (e.g., file type restriction, format restriction, document
          size limit). If your use violates these Terms, applicable laws or any
          applicable rule, we have the right to take corresponding measures,
          such as suspending or terminating your access to the corresponding
          Services, deleting your content which exceeds your entitled storage
          capacity or that fails to comply with the these Terms, applicable
          laws, or rules applicable to such cloud space storage feature.
        </p>

        <p>
          You shall always back up your content. We are not liable for any loss
          of your content or data stored by using the cloud space storage
          feature to the extent permitted by applicable laws.

        <p><strong>9. Unlockable Templates</strong></p>

        <p>
          Certain templates may be made available to help users to create videos
          more easily. Users can create a video by replacing certain images,
          photos or videos of such templates. But the elements of the templates
          that can be modified are limited if users use Free Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          We now make available a Premium Service where Users will be able to
          edit more elements of the templates (“<strong
            >Unlockable Templates</strong
          >“) through the premium editing function on the Platform of which the
          intellectual property right is owned by us. As mentioned above, our
          Services may not be available in all jurisdiction for all devices in
          all languages. Thus the Premium Service for the Unlockable Template
          may not be made available to you.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you subscribe to such Premium Service for our right-owned premium
          editing function to unlock templates, you have a limited right to use
          such premium editing function and edit the Unlockable Template during
          the applicable subscription term, provided that (a) the specific
          premium editing function and the specific Unlockable Template
          available to you may differ depending on your jurisdiction, device,
          language setting, etc. and (b) the specific elements of each
          Unlockable Template that can be edited may differ on a case-by-case
          basis, subject to the actual elements of such Unlockable Template made
          available for editing in practice on the Services, which may vary and
          be updated from time to time. Unlockable Templates edited by you will
          not be allowed to be posted as new templates on the Platform. Neither
          can you share or distribute Unlockable Templates you edited with other
          users nor otherwise permit others to use such Unlockable Templates you
          edited.
        </p>

        <p>
          Such Unlockable Templates are provided by third-party creators
          (“<strong>Creators</strong>”) rather than us. That is, such Unlockable
          Templates are not Company’s Content. We make no conditions,
          endorsement, representations or warranties with respect to any and all
          Unlockable Templates and elements and content therein.
        </p>

          No additional right or license of Company’s Content is granted,
          licensed or otherwise transferred to you arising from or in connection
          with your subscription to the Premium Service for our right-owned
          premium editing function to unlock templates or use of the Unlockable
          Templates. All rights to the Company’s Content granted to you are
          those expressly set forth in Section 12 below.

        </p>

        <p>

          Rather, the CapCut ad maker as a part of the Platform, which is a
          video editing tool, merely allows users to create their own
          advertising videos. The advertising tutorial templates provided under
          the CapCut ad maker are only for examples other than consitituting

            You may be able to access or use a feature of the Services that
            allows you to upload or transmit User Content to a third party
            platform or share User Content with other users. If you use such
            feature, you must comply with the content guideline of such third
            party platform as well the requirements set out in Section
            6&nbsp;<em>(Your Access to and Use of Our Services)</em>&nbsp;above.
            As noted above, such features may not be available to all users of
            the Services, and we have no liability to you for limiting your
            access to certain features of the Services. You warrant that you
            comply with those requirements, and you will be liable to us and
            indemnify us for any breach. This means you will be responsible for
            any loss or damage we suffer as a result of your breach of warranty.

            All User Content will be considered non-confidential. You must not

            or make available to us any User Content that you consider to be
            confidential or proprietary to any other person. When you upload or
            make available User Content through the Services, you agree,
            represent and warrant that you own such User Content, or you have
            received all necessary permissions (including any necessary
            licenses), clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any
            part of the content to submit such User Content to the Services,
            and/or to otherwise make any use of such User Content on or through

          <li>
            You must own your User Content or have obtained all necessary
            rights, license, clearances of any and all elements of your User
            Content. For example, if you only own the rights in and to a sound
            recording, but not to the underlying musical works embodied in such
            sound recordings, then you must not upload or otherwise make
            available such sound recordings on or through the Services unless
            you have all permissions (including any necessary licenses),
            clearances from, or are authorised by, the owner of any part of the

            Except as expressly provided otherwise in these Terms, you or the
            owner of your User Content still own the copyright and any other

            submitting User Content via the Services, you hereby grant us and
            our affiliates, agents, services providers, partners and other
            connected third parties an unconditional, irrevocable,
            non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully transferable (including

            reproduce, make derivative works of, display,&nbsp;publish,
            transmit, distribute and/or store your User Content for providing
            the Services for you.
          </li>

          <li>
            You further grant us and our affiliates, agents, services providers,
            partners and other connected third parties a royalty-free fully
            transferable (including sub-licensable), worldwide license to use
            your username, image and likeness to identify you as the source of
            any of your User Content, including for use in sponsored content.

          <li>
            For the avoidance of doubt, the rights granted in the preceding
            paragraphs of this Section include, but are not limited to, the
            right to reproduce sound recordings (and make mechanical
            reproductions of the musical works embodied in such sound
            recordings), and publicly perform and communicate to the public
            sound recordings (and the musical works embodied therein), all on a
            royalty-free basis. This means that you are granting us the right to
            use your User Content without the obligation to pay royalties to you
            or any third party, including, but not limited to, a sound recording
            copyright owner (e.g. a record label), a musical work copyright
            owner (e.g. a music publisher), a performing rights organization
            (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, etc.) (a “<strong>PRO</strong>“), a sound
            recording PRO (e.g. SoundExchange), collective management
            organisations (“<strong>CMOs</strong>“), any unions or guilds, and
            engineers, producers or other royalty participants that may be
            involved (either knowingly or otherwise) in the creation of User
            Content.

        <p>
          <strong
            >Specific Rules for Musical Works and for Recording Artists</strong
          >. If you are a composer or author of a musical work and are
          affiliated with a PRO or CMO, then you must notify your PRO or CMO of
          the royalty-free license you grant through these Terms in your User
          Content to us. You are solely responsible for ensuring your compliance
          with the relevant PRO’s or CMO’s reporting obligations and any other
          terms of that PRO or CMO applicable to you. If you have assigned your
          rights to a music publisher, then you must obtain the consent of such
          music publisher to grant the royalty-free license(s) set forth in
          these Terms in your User Content or have such music publisher enter
          into these Terms with us. Just because you authored a musical work
          (e.g. wrote a song) does not mean you have the right to grant us the
          licenses in these Terms. If you are a recording artist under contract
          with a record label, then you are solely responsible for ensuring that
          your use of the Services is in compliance with any contractual
          obligations you may have to your record label, including if you create
          any new recordings through the Services that may be claimed by your
          label.

        <p>
          <strong>Through-To-The-Audience Rights</strong>. All of the rights you
          grant in your User Content in these Terms are provided on a
          through-to-the-audience basis, meaning the owners or operators of
          third party services will not have any separate liability to you or
          any other third party arising out of or in connection with such
          availability of your User Content through such third party services.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Waiver of Rights to User Content</strong>. By uploading or
          making available User Content to or through the Services, you waive
          any rights to prior inspection or approval of any marketing,
          advertising or promotional materials related to such User Content. You
          also waive (to the extent permitted by applicable law) any and all
          rights of privacy, publicity, or any other rights of a similar nature
          in connection with your User Content, or any portion thereof. You
          hereby waive (to the extent permitted by applicable law) and agree
          never to assert any and all moral rights you may have in or with
          respect of any of the User Content you upload or otherwise make
          available through the Services, or to support, maintain or permit any
          action based on any such moral rights.
        </p>

        <p>
          We, or authorised third parties, reserve the right to cut, crop, edit
          or refuse to upload your content in our or their sole discretion. In
          addition, we have the right – but not the obligation – in our sole
          discretion to remove, disallow, block or delete any User Content (i)
          that we consider to violate these Terms (including without limitation
          the content standards set out at Section 6 above), or (ii) in response
          to complaints from other users or third parties, with or without
          notice and without any liability to you. As a result, you shall save
          copies of any User Content that you upload or make available to the
          Services on your personal device(s) in the event that you want to
          ensure that you have permanent access to copies of such User Content.

                Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will
                be governed by the AAA’s rules. If you are an individual and
                have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity,
                we will reimburse those fees for claims where the amount in
                dispute is less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines
                the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys’ fees
                and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the
                claims are frivolous.

                The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, will

                interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability,
                enforceability, or formation of this arbitration agreement,
                including any claim that all or any part of this arbitration
                agreement is void or voidable. However, the preceding sentence
                will not apply to the “Class Action Waiver” section below. To
                the extent a Claim for public injunctive relief is available to
                you, such Claim may only be heard by a court of law following
                the conclusion of a related arbitration on any other Claims.

                3. A statement that the user has a good faith belief that the

                misidentification of the material; and
              </li>

              <li>
                4. The user’s name, address, telephone number, and, if
                available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or

                the user’s address is located outside the United States, for any
                judicial district in which we are located, and that such person
                or entity will accept service of process from the person who
                provided notification of the alleged infringement.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>

          <li>
            If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we will
            forward a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining
            party informing that person that we may restore the removed material
            following 10 days. The original complaining party will then have 10
            days to notify us that he or she has filed legal action relating to
            the allegedly infringing material. If we do not receive any such
            notification within 10 days, we may restore the material, at our

        <p><strong>Renewal and Cancellation</strong></p>

        <p>
          If you subscribe to the Premium Services under an automatically
          renewable agreement, your subscription fee will automatically renew
          for an additional period equal in duration as your preceding
          subscription term unless indicated otherwise on the Platform, and your
          payment will automatically be charged at the start of each new
          subscription period for the fees applicable to that period, unless you
          cancel or change your subscription of the Premium Services before the
          end of the applicable subscription period.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you do not want to continue to be charged on a recurring basis, you
          must cancel your subscription of the Premium Services through your
          Apple ID/Google account before the end of the then-current
          subscription period. You can learn more about how to cancel your
          subscription of our Services in the FAQ. If you cancelled, you will
          still have access to the Premium Services until the end of the
          then-current subscription period and be charged the full subscription
          fee for such subscription period unless otherwise set forth in the
          “Supplemental Terms – Jurisdiction-Specific” section below or required
          by applicable law, e.g. if your cancelled the subscription for cause.
          After the cancellation takes effect on the last day of the
          then-current subscription period, you will be downgraded to the Free
          Services.
        </p>

        <p>
          If your Premium Services term expires and you do not renew or you
          downgrade to other Services, we have the right to cancel your
          corresponding Premium Services or downgrade those to the Services
          consistent with your actual payment, i.e. downgrade your cloud space
          storage capacity to the free storage capacity provided by the Platform
          or downgrade it to the corresponding capacity consistent with the
          amount you actually pay for. Within the time limit that we have
          notified you in advance, you should transfer and back up your content
          (including but not limited to your video drafts, photos, stickers and
          other materials) stored in the cloud space provided by the Platform
          under your Premium Services before the expiration of such Services,
          and ensure that the content you store does not exceed the storage
          capacity that you are entitled to use, so as to avoid the loss of your
          content and data due to the absence of sufficient cloud space storage
          capacity. We shall not be liable for any loss of content or data
          resulting from your failure to procure and pay for sufficient cloud
          space storage capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          Whether it is Free Services or Premium Services provided by the
          Platform, you will always use those services in accordance with all
          the relevant rules of the Platform, file type restriction, format
          restriction, size limit, etc. If your use violates any rule, we have
          the right to stop the corresponding Services, and delete content that
          exceeds your entitled storage capacity or that does not comply with
          the relevant rules. If you do not complete the back up or transfer of
          any relevant content within the time limit after being prompted by us,
          we shall not be liable for any resultant loss of content or data.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Cloud Space Services</strong></p>

        <p>
          You may access limited cloud storage space provided by us on a
          free-of-charge basis; and you may also access more cloud storage space
          by subscribing to the relevant Premium Services, if such Premium
          Services are made available to you. Depending on the relevant Service
          Plan applicable to you, the storage capacity of the cloud space
          allocated to you may differ. The allocated storage capacity applicable
          to the Premium Services you purchase will be displayed to you on the
          relevant Premium Services description page or when you make the
          purchase. You shall not use storage capacity exceeding the allocated
          storage capacity.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to these Terms, you shall comply with the applicable
          requirements and restrictions applicable to the cloud space storage
          services (e.g., file type restriction, format restriction, document
          size limit). If your use violates these Terms, applicable laws or any
          applicable rule, we have the right to take corresponding measures,
          such as suspending or terminating your access to the corresponding
          Services, deleting your content which exceeds your entitled storage
          capacity or that fails to comply with the these Terms, applicable
          laws, or rules applicable to such cloud space storage feature.

          <strong
            >Modification, Interruption and Termination of Services</strong

        </p>

        <p>
          We reserve the right to change our service plans, including adjusting
          features/services available if there is a valid reason for the change.
          A valid reason may be in particular (i) to implement changed legal
          requirements or case law, (ii) to implement changed technical
          requirements such as a new technical environment or other operational
          reasons, (iii) to maintain operations, (iv) to adapt to changed market
          conditions such as increased user numbers, and (v) for your benefit.
          You will not incur any additional costs for changes to the Service
          Plans and their functionality. We will inform you about the change in
          a clear and comprehensible manner.
        </p>

        <p>
          If a change to our service plans affects your ability to access or use
          the service plans more than insignificantly (“Significant Change”), we
          will inform you of this at least six weeks in advance by e-mail
          (“Change Notice”). The Change Notice will include the characteristics
          and timing for the Significant Change and describe your rights, which
          are as follows:
        </p>

        <p>
          In the event of Significant Changes, you have the right to terminate
          the contract free of charge with 30 days’ notice. The period begins
          once you received the Change Notice. If the change is made after you
          have received the Change Notice, the period shall only start once we
          implemented the change.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep the Services
          operational. However, we reserve the right to interrupt or modify the
          availability of the Services or any part thereof (including modifying
          or withdrawing any Services) from time to time such as for scheduled
          or emergency downtime, unless prohibited by applicable law. We will
          take your legitimate interests into account and will inform you of any
          restriction in good time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have subscribed to the Services, we will refund any
          subscription fees paid but not used on a pro rata basis to you if
          required by applicable law.
        </p>

        <p>Sections 14 and 15 of the terms are replaced by the following:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            For damages with respect to injury to health, body or life caused by
            us, our representatives or our agents in the performance of the
            contractual obligations, we are fully liable. We are fully liable
            for damages caused wilfully or by gross negligence by us, our
            representatives or our agents in the performance of the contractual
            obligations. The same applies to damages which result from the
            absence of a quality which was guaranteed by us or to damages which
            result from malicious action. If damages with respect to a breach of
            a contractual core duty are caused by slight negligence, we are
            liable only for the amount of the damage which was typically
            foreseeable. Contractual core duties, abstractly, are such duties
            whose accomplishment enables proper performance of an agreement in
            the first place and whose performance a contractual party regularly
            may rely on. Our liability based on the German Product Liability Act
            remains unaffected. Any further liability is excluded. The
            limitation period for claims for damages against us expires after
            one (1) year.
          </li>

          <li>
            These Terms, their subject matter and their formation, are governed

            consumer law in the European Union country in which you reside. The
            United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of
            Goods as well as any other similar law, regulation or statute in
            effect in any other jurisdiction shall not apply. You and CapCut
            irrevocably agree that the courts of the country in which you reside
            shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any dispute or claim
            (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in
            connection with this Agreement or its subject matter or formation.
